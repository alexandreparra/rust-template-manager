## Environment tests
These are real tests using a simple python script to make sure rtm is functioning properly.

To use this script you can point a custom path to `rtm` binary:
```shell
python3 test.py /path/to/rtm
```

If no path is provided `test.py` will assume rtm is installed at a known binary location.

Only Linux is supported by now.
